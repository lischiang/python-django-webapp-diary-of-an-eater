	<p>I am a software developer, and this is my first website in Python with Django.</p>
	<p>
		Here you can add records of the dishes that you have ordered and tried in restaurants; 
		in this way, next time you will go to a place, you will remember what you like in their menu!
	</p>
	</br>
	<p>I am working on improving the website... Stay tuned!</p>
